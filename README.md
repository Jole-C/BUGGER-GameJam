# BUGGER-GameJam
## First place winner of the LJMU Game Jam!
A portfolio repo for a university game jam project.

This project was created over the course of 2 days for a university game jam. The work was split into 3 portions:

- One student worked on the game's assets
- I worked on the logic for the tower firing, enemy logic and spawning (The majority of which is C++ based)
- One student worked on the game's flow, menus, UI, tower placement and destruction
